### About me

I am a currently an individual Postdoc at [sDiv](https://www.idiv.de/en/sdiv.html), the Synthesis center of the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig.

I am generally interested in population biology, which I have studied from the context of Ecology, Genetic and Conservation.

During my PhD research I was focusing on the genetic monitoring of Chimpanzee and Gorilla population. I collected and analyzed non-invasive genetic samples (i.e., poop samples) to estimate population size and growth of focal populations.

After an extensive career break (due to a vortex of department closure, maternity, Covid-19 and second maternity), I stepped back into research with the ambition to reconnect to population processes at a larger scale. My current project at sDiv makes use of publicly available microsatellite genotypes of vertebrates to investigate worldwide patterns in genetic diversity, across Latitudes and life-history strategies.
