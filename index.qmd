### Current job

I currently work at iDiv, the German Biodiversity Synthesis Center in [Jonathan Chase's group: Biodiversity Synthesis](https://www.idiv.de/en/groups-and-people/core-groups/synthesis.html).

As a Scientific programmer:

1.  I extract, aggregate, restructure, check and standardise data from the literature.
2.  I assist colleagues with R problems.
3.  I implement and encourage scientific software reproducibility practices, notably containerisation and automatic testing.
4.  I frequently talk about how great is the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) package.
5.  I use all of the above to build and grow research compendia extracting, restructuring, standardising and checking data in a documented and reproducible environment, publishing and archiving code and data.
6.  I write monthly newsletters to my colleagues which you can find [here](posts/tech-news/2023-07-21-tech-news-1/index.qmd).
7.  I occasionally build a package of functions used for a specific project such as the [`sRealmTools`](https://github.com/sRealmWG/sRealmTools) package or [`BioTIMEr`](https://github.com/bioTIMEHub/BioTIMEr).
8.  I co-maintain [`mobsim`](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobsim), a community simulation R package that we use for work, for [teaching](https://github.com/chase-lab/biodiv-patterns-course-2024/tree/main/week%202/3%20-%20Wednesday) and published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mobsim).

### Other activities

With [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org), I maintain or co-maintain [`parzer`](https://docs.ropensci.org/parzer/) and [`rgnparser`](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgnparser/).

### Building this website

I initially used Jekyll and the template Minimal Mistake by Michael Rose and
developed and built locally in Visual Studio Code. I wrote about this process in
[a blog post](posts/2024-01-10-website-building-1/index.qmd). 

This version of the website was built using Quarto which seems easier to me and 
better integrated in my workflow.
